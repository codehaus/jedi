            </div>
            
            <p>This question is asked about almost every language, library, concept or technology when it is introduced. Sometimes the question expresses a genuine concern. Frequently
                however, it appears almost as a throat clearing utterance for those who want to give the illusion of some deep thought. In such cases, those asking the question are often
                unwilling to embrace the consequences of fully answering the question.</p>
            <p>In the case of Jedi, there may be a <i>very</i> minor performance impact due to closure instantiation. However, it is likely to be lost in the noise of general object
                instantiation that any Java system will cause and that you as a developer will probably not even be aware is happening most of the time. In addition, if for example, a
                non-memory database or network IO is in use, then this performance impact will be several orders of magnitude below that caused by these things. This is much more than made
                up for by the clarity, simplicity and probably 'more correct' code that will result from Jedi's use.</p>
            <p>If you are still worried about performance, I ask you to consider whether Java itself is adequate for your needs. Maybe C/C++ would be better. Failing that, how about OCaml.
                Or how about machine code? If that is still inadequate, electronics might do the trick. Maybe optics might perform just fast enough for your needs...</p>
            <p>Many would consider the last few options listed above as going too far or maybe a little ridiculous. I consider these options perfectly viable given the condition that the
                performance yeilded by them is required. I consider the rejection of them foolish and indicative of the original questions baselessness.</p>
            
            <div class="sectionHeading"><a name="forEach"/>What is the Point of <a
                    href="javadoc/jedi/functional/FunctionalPrimitives.html#forEach(java.util.Collection,%20jedi.functional.Command)"
                    title="JavaDoc for jedi.functional.FunctionalPrimitives.forEach() method">FunctionalPrimitives.forEach()</a>? </div>
            <p>The full question here is 'Does <a
                    href="javadoc/jedi/functional/FunctionalPrimitives.html#forEach(java.util.Collection,%20jedi.functional.Command)"
                    title="JavaDoc for jedi.functional.FunctionalPrimitives.forEach() method">FunctionalPrimitives.forEach()</a> have any benefits over JDK 1.5's new
                <code>for</code> loop construct when we simply want to invoke something on every item in a collection?' It is questionable. The new <code>for</code> loop construct
                removes conditional logic associated with looping and therefore, although branching is implied, could reasonably be considered as representing a linear segment of
                code.</p>
            <p>There is certainly truth in the notion that, in software, on the one hand we have machine code and on the other, we have different ways of thinking about programming.
                Sometimes a small piece of syntactic sugar such as the <code>for</code> loop construct can bring up interesting questions such as this one. You will have to judge for
                yourself the conditions under which it makes sense to use <a
                    href="javadoc/jedi/functional/FunctionalPrimitives.html#forEach(java.util.Collection,%20jedi.functional.Command)"
                    title="JavaDoc for jedi.functional.FunctionalPrimitives.forEach() method">FunctionalPrimitives.forEach()</a> instead.</p>

            <div class="sectionHeading"><a name="OO"/>Don't Jedi Annotations Encourage non-OO Code?</div>
            <p>No. We have found that it encourages better encapsulation and abstraction because it is easier to place annotations under these conditions; logic seems to be encouraged
                into more appropriate places in order to have a method on which to place an annotation.</p>

            <div class="sectionHeading"><a name="similarProjects"/>Are There Any Other Similar Projects?</div>
            <p>Plenty. However, we wanted a genericised set of closures and utility functions which we could not find. We also wanted the annotations. We are not aware of any other projects
                that do anything similar to Jedi's annotations.</p>
