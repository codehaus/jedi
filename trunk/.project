  <comment>Java&apos;s syntactic and library support for these components tends to cause the above concerns to be mixed
        with each other, with other concerns, and with low-level implementation details. This means that the code is
        cluttered, verbose and does not express intent very well.

        Jedi aims to repair this by providing a library of routines for filtering, iteration, conversion from
        one collection type to another, first order logic functions, etc. It makes extensive use of higher order
        functions and closures (also known as &apos;blocks&apos; or &apos;lambdas&apos; that can be implemented manually or by annotations. NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files created with the maven-eclipse-plugin are not supported in M2Eclipse.</comment>
