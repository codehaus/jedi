            <div class="sectionHeading"><a name="forEach"/>What is the Point of <a
                    href="javadoc/jedi/functional/FunctionalPrimitives.html#forEach(java.util.Collection,%20jedi.functional.Command)"
                    title="JavaDoc for jedi.functional.FunctionalPrimitives.forEach() method">FunctionalPrimitives.forEach()</a>? </div>
            <p>The full question here is 'Does <a
                    href="javadoc/jedi/functional/FunctionalPrimitives.html#forEach(java.util.Collection,%20jedi.functional.Command)"
                    title="JavaDoc for jedi.functional.FunctionalPrimitives.forEach() method">FunctionalPrimitives.forEach()</a> have any benefits over JDK 1.5's new
                <code>for</code> loop construct when we simply want to invoke something on every item in a collection?' It is questionable. The new <code>for</code> loop construct
                removes conditional logic associated with looping and therefore, although branching is implied, could reasonably be considered as representing a linear segment of
                code.</p>
            <p>There is certainly truth in the notion that, in software, on the one hand we have machine code and on the other, we have different ways of thinking about programming.
                Sometimes a small piece of syntactic sugar such as the <code>for</code> loop construct can bring up interesting questions such as this one. You will have to judge for
                yourself the conditions under which it makes sense to use <a
                    href="javadoc/jedi/functional/FunctionalPrimitives.html#forEach(java.util.Collection,%20jedi.functional.Command)"
                    title="JavaDoc for jedi.functional.FunctionalPrimitives.forEach() method">FunctionalPrimitives.forEach()</a> instead.</p>

            <div class="sectionHeading"><a name="OO"/>Don't Jedi Annotations Encourage non-OO Code?</div>
            <p>No. We have found that it encourages better encapsulation and abstraction because it is easier to place annotations under these conditions; logic seems to be encouraged
                into more appropriate places in order to have a method on which to place an annotation.</p>

            <div class="sectionHeading"><a name="similarProjects"/>Are There Any Other Similar Projects?</div>
            <p>Plenty. However, we wanted a genericised set of closures and utility functions which we could not find. We also wanted the annotations. We are not aware of any other projects
                that do anything similar to Jedi's annotations.</p>

            <div class="sectionHeading"><a name="scala"/>Are You Aware of Scala?</div>
            <p>Yes. If you can use it instead of Java, do so.</p>

            <div class="sectionHeading"><a name="javaClosures"/>Are You Aware of the Introduction of Closures in Java 1.7 / JDK7 / J7EE / Whatever It Is?</div>
            <p>Yes. In many cases this may obviate the need for Jedi. The presence of the generated closure factories may still be useful however.</p>
