1. Change the version.number property in build.xml to be the one you want to release and check in build.xml
2. Wait for a build on the Codehaus Bamboo: http://bamboo.ci.codehaus.org/browse/JEDI-DEF
3. In Bamboo, go to the latest build and select the 'Artifacts' tab
4. Download the jedi.zip file
5. Strip the timestamp from the end of the file so it looks like 'jedi_x.y'
6. Copy the downloaded jedi.zip to the Codehaus webdav location: https://dav.codehaus.org/dist/jedi/
7. That's it
